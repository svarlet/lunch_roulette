** Shortlist [0/2]
*** Decide between:
**** a shortlist behaviour and a unique process named after the module so we don't need to pass a pid but we lose async testing
**** a shortlist behaviour and we require an extra pid param
**** a shortlist protocol, this allow to hide specific detail of the implementation (ets? ecto? agent?) but Mox won't help to mock dependencies
*** TODO shortlisted -> {:error, :already_shortlisted}
*** TODO not listed -> {:ok, restaurant}
** Feedback [0/4]
*** TODO report_success -> :ok
*** TODO report_already_shortlisted -> :ok
*** TODO report_invalid_submission -> :ok
*** TODO Make a case template as many impl are likely to exist
